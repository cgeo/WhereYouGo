WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching. It uses offline vector maps, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.

<b>Important note:
    <br/>
    This is a dedicated legacy version of WhereYouGo for Android 4.0 devices to maintain basic functionality.
    <br/>
    Future versions might no longer be available or only contain important bugfixes! Please consider using a device with a newer Android versions to be able to use WhereYouGo in future.

    The development of WhereYouGo was no longer continued by the last open source development team. After contacting the original author, the c:geo team has been able to take over the source code to make it available again for the open source community to allow further bugfixing and enhancement of WhereYouGo.
    <br/>
    In a first step we managed to fix the download function for cartridges, thus restoring the original functionality.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For further development however we need help of the Geocaching community:
