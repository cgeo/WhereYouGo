WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching. It uses offline vector maps, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Important note:
<br/>
The development of WhereYouGo was no longer continued by the last open source development team.
<br/>
After contacting the original author, the c:geo team has been able to take over the source code to make it available again for the open source community to allow further bugfixing and enhancement of WhereYouGo.
<br/>
In a first step managed to fix the download function for cartridges, thus restoring the original functionality.
<br/>
For further development however we need help of the Geocaching community:
<br/>

Cartridges for the game can be downloaded at

<br/>
<br/>
Download cartridges for Pocket PC Device. Other versions are not tested (but it's possible they will work). Download cartridges into 'sdcard/WhereYouGo' directory, or you can specify your own directory in settings.
