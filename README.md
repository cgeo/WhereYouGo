WhereYouGo
==========

WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching. It displays online and offline vector maps using Mapsforge library, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.

## About

This is a clone of this [WhereYouGo repository](https://github.com/biylda/WhereYouGo/) as it was found unmaintained and was (after confirmation of original author) transfered to here. 
Development can be continued seamless as we got the ability and allowance to publish the app under the original accounts and signing keys.

## Development

### Build
to be completed

### Branches
- **master** is for development of new features.
- **release** is for all bug fixes of already existing features. So if a bug is reported in released version, it should be fixed on this branch (and merged to master afterwards).

A more complex bugfix can be first tested against the `master` branch while kept compatible with the `release` branch for a later integration.
Such a procedure is [described in the c:geo wiki](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/wiki/How-to-get-a-bug-fix-into-the-release) which can also be applied in principle to this repository.

### Dependencies
Uses the following projects:

* [openwig](https://github.com/cgeo/openwig)
