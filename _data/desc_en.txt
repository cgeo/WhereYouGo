WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching. It displays online and offline vector maps using Mapsforge library, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.

Notice:
- Cartridges are downloadable from http://www.wherigo.com, use version "Pocket PC Device". Your device must support TLS, otherwise there will be an error during connection.
- If you don't use the built-in download function, copy cartridges into your Wherigo folder (Settings - Main - Wherigo folder). Make sure you granted the application permission to write to external storage and you have write permission in selected directory. Some newer devices don't allow writing to SD card. If you're not sure, set "Wherigo folder" automatically.
