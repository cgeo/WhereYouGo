WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching.

It supports playing Wherigo cartridges, which is an interactive location based geocaching game. You can load, play and save the current state of your Wherigo game. Compass and online or offline maps can be used to navigate, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.

About:
WhereYouGo is OpenSource and licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0.

After the source code was unmaintained for several years, a new development team (the c:geo team) was - with agreement of the orignal author - finally able to take over the source code and continue app development.
If you are able and willing to help us, you can find information and source code in the link below. We need your help: https://github.com/cgeo/WhereYouGo
The core of the application is based on OpenWIG, it uses the Mapsforge library to display maps, alternatively Locus can be used.

Notes:
- When manually downloading cartridges from wherigo.com, make sure to use the version "Pocket PC Device". 
- Copy the cartridges into your Wherigo folder (Settings - Main - Wherigo folder). Make sure you granted the application permission to write to external storage and you have write permission in selected directory. Some newer devices don't allow writing to SD card. If you're not sure, set "Wherigo folder" automatically.
